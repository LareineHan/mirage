## Mirage Tutorial
Friday, April 28, 2023 in Flagstaff, AZ

#This is the Reminders app for the official Mirage tutorial.
I followed every step in this tutorial. I'm still taking baby steps on all the coding projects.
While working on API projects, API usage limits bugged me so much. That's why I've somehow wanted to look at MirageJS to get the idea of making mock API data for JavaScript practice and beyond.

Official guide of mirage you can get here [miragejs.com/tutorial](https://miragejs.com/tutorial) to follow along. 

Happy mocking!
