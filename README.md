This is the Reminders app for the official Mirage tutorial.
I followed every steps in this tutorial. Still figuring out some errors occured during the study. 
On my journey studying Javascrip Api project.. free Api usage limit bugged me so much. That's why I am looking at MirageJS to get the idea of making mock API datas for 
JS practice and further. 

If your need official guide, check out [miragejs.com/tutorial](https://miragejs.com/tutorial) to follow along. 

Happy mocking!
